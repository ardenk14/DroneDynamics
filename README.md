# DroneDynamics

Adding autonomous capabilities to a inexpensive quadcopter by:
1) Reverse engineering the communications between the drone and it's controller to control it from a personal computer.
2) Learning the rigid-body dynamics of the quadcopter.
3) Learning to estimate motion and depth from monocular image sequences.
4) Path planning in the depth image space and controls using the learned dynamics model and MPPI.

## Drone Information
Drone model: Holy Stone F180C

This drone model may be discontinued, though some can be found for second-hand sale online. The methods used to gain control of this drone can likely be reproduced on other inexpensive hobby drones.
